            It is no sercet that war thunder is very hard to grind<br>
            so I try to make a simple guide to make it alot easier.<br>
            So I'll be trying to help you grind from tier 1 to tier 3
        </p>
        <ul>
            <a href="#rank1"><il>:Rank 1</il><br></a>
            <a href="#rank2"><il>:Rank 2</il><br></a>
            <a href="#rank3"><il>:Rank 3</il><br></a>
        </ul>
        <h1 id="rank1" class="center_text">=============Rank 1=============</h1>
        
        <p class="center_text">
            Rank 1 is probably the easiest rank to grind through.<br>
            The first planes you want to get is the P-36C and the P-36G.<br>
            The p-36C and G variant is hard hiting, great climb speed and good<br>
            turn rate.
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.redd.it/kayaewmjhcq81.png" class="img_center">
        <p class="center_text">
            The difference with the P-36C and P-36G is the G has two extra .50 cal<br>
            which is extremely helpful when facing armor targets like bomber or yak-1.<br>
            then spade them.
        </p>

        <p class="center_text">
            The next best plane would be the F2A-1 and the F2A-3 buffalo.As you can<br>
            probably guess the <em>F2A-3 is better</em> than the A-1 variant it has a great<br>
            turn time, great diving speed, and an carrier aircraft. Now it is <em>important<br>
            that you spade</em> every aircraft <em>you are good at</em> because once you spade it you become<br>
            <em>more powerful.</em>

        <h1 id="rank2" class="center_text">=============Rank 2=============</h1>
            <p class="center_text">
                Rank 2 gets more fun but also <em>harder</em> and <em>american</em> can be <em>frustrating to fly</em><br>
                but if you uses the <em>right tactics</em> you can the <em>biggest threat</em> in the match. The planes i personally<br>
                recommend is the P-400, P-40, and the <em>F4U-A1 corsair.</em>.
            </p>

            <p class="center_text">
                The <em>P-400</em> is a good pick for a <em>hard hiting</em> aircraft for rank 2. It has a<br>
                <em>20mm cannon</em> mounted is the nose which can <em>destroy</em> an aircraft and almost <em>one shot</em><br>
                and 2 <em>.50 cal</em> also nose mounted and 4 <em>7.62mm</em> wing mounted which is like 4 ak.<br>
                Now <em>american can't really dogfight</em> but if you're good you can dogfight<br>
                but the best tactic to uses is the <em>boom and zoom</em> tactic. Boom and Zoom is<br>
                when you <em>climb</em> and then <em>dive</em> on your enemies, but american aircraft are not the<br>
                at climbing so you <em>side climb</em>. an another great tactic is the <em>hit and run.</em><br>
                To do that tactic you have to be fast. Pick your target shoot him then zoom away.<br>
                <img src="https://wiki.warthunder.com/images/thumb/2/22/Boom_and_Run_001.png/500px-Boom_and_Run_001.png" class="img_center" >
            </p>
            <p class="center_text">
                The P-40 warhawk has six .50 cal and its a great turn fighter at low altitude but high altitude <br>
                it doesn't do to well. Personally I would uses this aircraft for hit and run so pick your target<br>
                careful.

            </p>
            <p class="center_text">
                The best plane in rank 2 is the F4U-A1 corsair also call the <strong>whispering death</strong> and it earn that name.<br>
                This aircraft has six 6 .50 cal that <em>destroy</em> any one in its way, it is also a great<br>
                turn fighter. Its primary tactic it the boom and zoom and the hit amd run because of its<br>
                great speed, acceleration and energy retention and if you play sim battles it will give<br>
                you good slive lions.

            <h1 id="rank3" class="center_text">=============Rank 3=============</h1>
            <p class="center_text">
                <em>"This is where the fun begins"</em>. This rank 3 is the best rank to have fun in<br>
                and personally the P-63, P-51C-10, and the F4U-D1 corsair are the best at this rank.<br>
                <img src="https://preview.redd.it/slxlgyycck791.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=61d186b64ee63c4bf89d7730d8315fb5f518b59e" class="img_center" >
            </p>
            <p class="center_text">
                The P-63 has one 37mm cannon, 2 .50 cal nose mounted, and 2 .50 wing mounted<br>
                which is devastating. You will need to side but the hit and run is awesome <br>
                 with this aircraft because of it is fire power and it speed. This aircraft<br>
                 has a great turn time<br>
                 <img src="https://rare-gallery.com/uploads/posts/1186311-vehicle-airplane-aircraft-propeller-military-aircraft-North-American-P-51-Mustang-War-Thunder-Bomber-air-force-Flight-Douglas-SBD-Dauntless-Gaijin-Entertainment-aviatio.jpg" class="img_center" >
            </p>
            <p class="center_text">
                The P-51C-10 is a different type of Mustang you probably have not seen before.<br>
                P-51C-10 has a red tail because of the 332nd Fighter Group which were know as<br>
                <strong>red tails</strong> they were the first <em>African-American</em> fighter group in America.<br>
                The P-51C-10 has 4 .50 cal which don't do much, but it highly agile at high speeds <br>
                and is great for hit and run. The key to this aircraft is to keep its speed up <br>
                and be mindful on who you choose.

            </p>
            <p class="center_text">
                The F4U-D1 is a great aircraft for boom and zoom or hit and run.<br>
                With 6 .50 cal you are a <em>threat</em> if you know how to use this aircraft.<br>
                You will need to side climb and it is not as agile as the A1 variant <br>
                but it is very <em>fast</em> so you can hit your enemies and speed away from them<br>
